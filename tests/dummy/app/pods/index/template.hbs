  <h1 class='creepy'>The legend of the <span class='red'>weredot</span> of Ciena</h1>

  <p>
    Once upon a time there was a normal dot.  Just an ordinary, nothing to see here, dot.
    It lived in an app with other little dots, punctuating i's and ending sentences as dots like to do.
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    <div class='code'>
      {{code-snippet name='normal.hbs'}}
    </div>
    <div class='demo'>
      {{! BEGIN-SNIPPET normal }}
      {{normal-dot
        size=5
        speak='Punctuation, huzzah!'
      }}
      {{! END-SNIPPET normal }}
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    One day the dot decided to play in a new app.  The app was beautiful and filled with shapes the dot had
    never seen before.
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    {{normal-dot
      size=5
      speak='Pointy?'
    }}
    <span style='width: 40px;' />
    {{were-triangle
      size=20
      speak='Round?'
    }}
  </div>

  <p>
    The dot enjoyed exploring the new app, but it couldn't shake the feeling that something
    was wrong.  What the dot didn't realize was that the app was home to a powerful developer, who wanted
    till fill the world with triangles and hated dots.  Angered by the dot's intrusion the developer used
    a forbidden (private) API (<a href='http://emberjs.com/api/#method_defineProperty'>defineProperty</a> and
    <a href='https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v2.9.1/packages/ember-runtime/lib/system/core_object.js#L153'>setUnknownProperty</a>)
    and cursed the dot with a mixin, casting it out from the triangle app.
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    {{code-snippet name='mixin.js'}}
  </div>

  <p>
    The dot returned home and while it felt a little...bigger?...it was otherwise still a normal dot
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    <div class='code'>
      {{code-snippet name='dot-options.hbs'}}
      {{code-snippet name='dot-options.js'}}
    </div>
    <div class='demo'>
      {{! BEGIN-SNIPPET dot-options }}
      {{normal-dot options=dotOptions}}
      {{! END-SNIPPET dot-options }}
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    ...but as night fell the dot began to <button {{action 'change'}}>CHANGE</button>
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    <div class='code'>
      {{code-snippet name='were-dynamic.hbs'}}
      {{code-snippet name='were-options.js'}}
      {{code-snippet name='change.js'}}
    </div>
    <div class='demo'>
      {{! BEGIN-SNIPPET were-dynamic }}
      {{component wereShape
        options=wereOptions
        spreadOptions=(hash
          context=this
          source='wereOptions'
        )
      }}
      {{! END-SNIPPET were-dynamic }}
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    An edge appeared, then another and another until the dot was quite different indeed.  In fact, it
    wasn't a dot at all anymore, it was a <button {{action 'transform'}}>TRIANGLE</button>
  </p>

  <div class='example'>
    <div class='code'>
      {{code-snippet name='transform.js'}}
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The next morning the dot returned to normal; however, it worried for the safety of the other dots and
    resolved to find a new home, far from the rest of its app.  That was the last anyone heard from the
    dot, but legend has it that when the builds are right, in the middle of the night, you can still hear
    the lone cry of the were-dot, <button {{action 'haunt'}}>HAUNTING</button> Ciena.
